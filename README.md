DeAuth is a tool that makes life easier for remembering passwords. You wonâ€™t need to find strong passwords and try to remember passwords anymore. Almost 1 million people got hacked last year and %80 people forgot their passwords in the last 90 days. With DeAuth, we aim to solve this issue with blockchain technology.

```
Connect your wallet.
```
```
Select your social media account.
```
```
And link.
```
```
Get a unique password thanks to your wallet's signature.
```
```
For the first time, this information will be recorded on the blockchain network.
```
```
Remember not your password! Your password is always re-signed.
```
```
Your wallet will always produce the same result unless you remove it.
```
```
Get your password and change it on your social media account.
```
```
Congratulations!
```
```
You don't have to remember anymore. All you have to do is log into DeAuth and link your wallet.
